									<h1>AUTONOMOUS<br />
									SOLAR PANEL CLEANING ROBOT</h1>
									
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Solar.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The solar panel cleaning robot was developed to offer an autonomous solution for maintaining the efficiency of solar energy systems. Its mechanical design focuses on durability, adaptability, and efficient operation in harsh environments. Key components include a robust steel chassis, a versatile robotic arm, and a high-performance tracked system. Each element was carefully designed to ensure reliable navigation and thorough cleaning of solar panels across various terrains.</p>

								<h1>CHASSIS<br />
									</h1>
							</header>
							<div class="image main"><img src="images/Chassis.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The chassis serves as the foundation of the robot, providing stability and durability. It is constructed using steel square hollow tubes, selected for their strength and availability. The chassis has been designed to be simple, ensuring ease of manufacturing. Stress analysis confirmed that the chassis could withstand a load of up to 400 kgf, with minimal deformation of only 0.8 mm, ensuring reliability. Two wings extend from the chassis to support the tracked chains, and additional analysis confirmed their ability to handle expected loads.</p>

									<h1>ROBOTIC ARM<br />
										</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/arm.png" alt="" /></div>
									<p>The robot's arm is designed for precise and efficient cleaning. It consists of two links and a base, with a rotating brush as the cleaning tool. The arm is controlled by linear DC motors that adjust its movement to match the angle of the solar panels. Potentiometers and reed sensors help monitor the arm’s position, ensuring accurate and effective cleaning. The arm's design prioritizes adaptability to accommodate various panel configurations, ensuring thorough cleaning​.</p>
									
									<header class="minor">
										<h1>TRACKED SYSTEM<br />
											</h1>
									</header>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/Solar design (2).png" alt="" /></div>
										<p>The robot uses a tracked motion system to navigate rough terrain typically found in solar farms. The track system includes metal core plates designed for flexibility and durability. The tracks are driven by motors through a sprocket and chain system, which ensures smooth movement across the ground. A suspension system inspired by military tank designs (Horizontal Volute Spring System) helps absorb shocks, keeping the robot stable during operation. The tracked system also ensures low ground pressure, preventing damage to the solar panels or the ground below​​.</p>
